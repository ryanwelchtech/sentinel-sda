# Mission Overview

## Mission Statement
Provide resilient, secure, and continuous space domain awareness through the fusion of multi-source sensor data and adaptive mission planning.

## Operational Context
Space systems operate in contested, degraded, and denied environments. Loss or degradation of sensors, latency in communications, or data integrity attacks must not result in total mission failure.

SENTINEL-SDA models this environment by simulating:
- Multiple heterogeneous sensors
- Imperfect data
- Component failures
- Adversarial conditions

## Mission Success Criteria
- Tracks remain available and queryable during partial system failure
- Mission priorities are reflected in sensor tasking decisions
- Observability data demonstrates system health and degradation modes
- Security controls prevent untrusted data from influencing mission decisions

## Stakeholders
- Mission operators
- Systems engineers
- Security engineers
- Program leadership

## Assumptions
- Sensor data is simulated and time-synchronized
- Orbital mechanics are abstracted
- Mission priorities are configurable
