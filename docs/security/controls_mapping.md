# Security Controls Mapping

## NIST 800-53 (Selected)

AC-3  
Enforced via authenticated service APIs and role separation

IA-2  
Service identity validated via JWT tokens

SI-7  
Input validation and integrity checks on observation data

AU-2  
Audit logs generated for tasking decisions and errors

SC-7  
NetworkPolicies restrict service-to-service communication

## Zero Trust Principles
- Never trust sensor input
- Authenticate every service call
- Minimize blast radius through segmentation
